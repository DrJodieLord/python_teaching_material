# BSc Python Teaching Material

This repository contains per-session and per-session solution files used as learning material for the BSc Psychology "Big Data Analytics in Python" mini module. 

All material is taught using the [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org/) web application and assumes access via the [**anaconda**](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) python distribution.

- Image files which feed into the session1 .ipynb document.

#### Session 1 solutions folder contains:
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with session 1 solutions included.
- .hmtl file with content identical to .ipynb, but in read only format.

#### Session 1 content:
- Accessing and understanding Python
- Jupyter basics
- Variable assignment and types
- Basic arithmetic
- Lists and tuples
- Dictionaries

## Session 2

#### Session 2 folder contains:
- Jupyter Notebook (`Session2.ipynb`) with learning material.
- Image files which feed into the session2 .ipynb document.
- 2 .csv files for pandas related tasks within the session2 learning material.

#### Session 2 solutions folder contains:
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with session 2 solutions included.
- .hmtl file with content identical to .ipynb, but in read only format.

#### Session 3 learning objectives:
1. Explore the world of charting in python via two key charting libraries:
  * MatPlotLib 
  * seaborn 
2. Learn how to carry out some basic statistics.
